  - title: "Cleaning your data"
    desc: >
      Functions for cleaning and optimising your data, to be able to add
      variables later on (like taxonomic properties) or to fix and extend
      antibiotic interpretations by applying [EUCAST rules](http://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_intrinsic_resistance/).

  - title: "Enhancing your data"
    desc: >
      Functions to add new data to your existing data, such as the determination
      of first isolates, multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRO), getting
      properties of microorganisms or antibiotics and determining the age of
      patients or divide ages into age groups.

    desc: >
      These functions are mostly for internal use, but some of
      them may also be suitable for your analysis. Especially the
      'like' function can be useful: `if (x %like% y) {...}`.

      These functions are deprecated, meaning that they will still
      work but show a warning with every use and will be removed
      in a future version.
