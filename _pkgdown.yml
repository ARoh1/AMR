  - title: "Cleaning your data"
    desc: >
      Functions for cleaning and optimising your data, to be able to add
      variables later on (like taxonomic properties) or to fix and extend
      antibiotic interpretations by applying [EUCAST rules](http://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_intrinsic_resistance/).

  - title: "Adding variables to your data"
    desc: >
      Functions to add new data to existing data, like the determination
      of first isolates, multi-drug resistant microorganisms (MDRO), getting
      properties of microorganisms or antibiotics and determining the age of
      patients or divide ages into age groups.

      Functions for conducting AMR analysis, like counting isolates, calculating
      resistance or susceptibility, or make plots.

  - title: Other functions
    desc: >
      These functions are mostly for internal use, but some of
      them may also be suitable for your analysis. Especially the
      'like' function can be useful: `if (x %like% y) {...}`.

      These functions are extensions of functions in other packages.
    contents:
    - "`extended-functions`"
  - title:  functions
    desc: >
      These functions are deprecated, meaning that they still
      work but show a warning with every use and will be removed
      in a future version.
